# Create a hierarchy out of birds.
# Implement 4 classes:

# class Bird with an attribute name and methods fly and walk.
# class FlyingBird with attributes name, ration, and with the same methods. ration must have a default value.
# Implement the method eat which will describe its typical ration.
# class NonFlyingBird with same characteristics but which obviously without attribute fly.
# Add the same "eat" method but with other implementation regarding the swimming bird tastes.
# class SuperBird which can do all of it: walk, fly, swim and eat.
# But be careful which "eat" method you inherit.

# Implement str() function call for each class.
# Example:

# >>> b = Bird("Any")
# >>> b.walk()
# "Any bird can walk"

# p = NonFlyingBird("Penguin", "fish")
# >> p.swim()
# "Penguin bird can swim"
# >>> p.fly()
# AttributeError: 'Penguin' object has no attribute 'fly'
# >>> p.eat()
# "It eats mostly fish"

# c = FlyingBird("Canary")
# >>> str(c)
# "Canary bird can walk and fly"
# >>> c.eat()
# "It eats mostly grains"

# s = SuperBird("Gull")
# >>> str(s)
# "Gull bird can walk, swim and fly"
# >>> s.eat()
# "It eats mostly fish"


# Have a look at the mro method or the attribute __mro__ of your last class.
